There is a differention between listening to everyone and sharing just to contacts/own devices, as the latter requires a google account, I won't focus on it for now

When sharing the service UUID 0000fe2c-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb is used
When ready to receive the service UUID 0000fef3-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb is used

The format for sharing with everyone is like with regular bluetooth a plaintext string, some examples

To get this string as well as the devices receiving/sharing, the script ble_get_devices.py can be used
